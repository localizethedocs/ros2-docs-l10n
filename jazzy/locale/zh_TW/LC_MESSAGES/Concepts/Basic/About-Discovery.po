"Discovery of nodes happens automatically through the underlying middleware "
"of ROS 2. It can be summarized as follows:"

msgid ""
"When a node is started, it advertises its presence to other nodes on the "
"network with the same ROS domain (set with the ROS_DOMAIN_ID environment "
"variable). Nodes respond to this advertisement with information about "
"themselves so that the appropriate connections can be made and the nodes can "
"communicate."

"Nodes periodically advertise their presence so that connections can be made "
"with new-found entities, even after the initial discovery period."

"Take the :ref:`talker-listener demo <talker-listener>` for example. Running "
