"``ament_cmake`` is the build system for CMake based packages in ROS 2 (in "
"particular, it will be used for most C/C++ projects). It is a set of scripts "
"enhancing CMake and adding convenience functionality for package authors. "
"Before using ``ament_cmake``, it is very helpful to know the basics of "
"`CMake <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.8/>`__. An official tutorial can be "
"found `here <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index."

"a bit of metadata to allow colcon to find the correct build order for your "
"packages, to install the required dependencies in CI, and to provide the "
