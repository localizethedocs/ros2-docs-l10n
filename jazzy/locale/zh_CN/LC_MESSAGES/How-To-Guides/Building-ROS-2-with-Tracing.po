"Tracing instrumentation is included in the ROS 2 source code, and Linux "
"installations of ROS 2 include the LTTng tracer as a dependency. Therefore, "
"ROS 2 can be traced out-of-the-box on Linux."

"However, ROS 2 can be built from source to remove the tracepoints or "
"completely remove the instrumentation. This guide shows how to do that. For "
"more information, see `the repository <https://github.com/ros2/"
"ros2_tracing>`__."

"The ROS 2 tracing instrumentation is split into two components: function "
"instrumentation and tracepoints. First, a ROS 2 core package (e.g., "
"``rclcpp``) calls a function provided by the ``tracetools`` package. Then, "
"that function triggers a tracepoint, which records data if the tracepoint is "
"enabled at runtime."

"By default, if the tracer is not `configured to trace or if the tracepoints "
"are not enabled <https://github.com/ros2/ros2_tracing#tracing>`__, they will "
"have virtually no impact on the execution. However, the tracepoints can "
"still be removed through a CMake option. Furthermore, the functions can be "
"completely removed through a CMake option, which implies that tracepoints "
"are also removed."
