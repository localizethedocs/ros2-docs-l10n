"The ``sros2`` package provides the tools and instructions to use ROS 2 on "
"top of DDS-Security. The security features have been tested across platforms "
"(Linux, macOS, and Windows) as well as across different languages (C++ and "
"Python). The SROS2 has been designed to work with any secure middleware, "
"although not all middleware is open source and support varies depending on "
