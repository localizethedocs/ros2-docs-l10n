"Server v2 implements a network traffic reduction scheme that limits the "
"discovery data between participants that do not share a topic. This means "
"that nodes will only receive topic's discovery data if it has a writer or a "
"reader for that topic. As most ROS 2 CLIs need a node in the network (some "

"using the Discovery Server v2 these nodes will not have all the network "
"information, and thus their functionality will be limited."
