"Fix gcc warnings when building with optimizations. (`#672 <https://github."
"com/ros2/demos/issues/672>`__) (`#673 <https://github.com/ros2/demos/"
"issues/673>`__) * Fix gcc warnings when building with optimizations. When "
"building the allocator_tutorial_pmr demo with -O2, gcc is throwing an error "
"saying that new and delete are mismatched.  This is something of a misnomer, "
"however; the real problem is that the global new override we have in that "
"demo is actually implemented incorrectly. In particular, the documentation "
"at https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/operator_new very clearly "
"specifies that operator new either has to return a valid pointer, or throw "
"an exception on error. Our version wasn't throwing the exception, so change "
"it to throw std::bad_alloc if std::malloc fails. While we are in here, also "
"fix another small possible is where std::malloc could return nullptr on a "
"zero-sized object, thus throwing an exception it shouldn't. * Always inline "
"the new and delete operators. That's because gcc 13 has a bug where it can "
"sometimes inline one or the other, and then it detects that they mismatch.  "
"For gcc and clang, just force them to always be inline in this demo. * "
"Switch to NOINLINE instead. Both clang and MSVC don't like inlining these, "
"so instead ensure that they are *not* inlined.  This also works because the "
"problem is when new is inlined but not delete (or vice-versa).  As long as "
"they are both not inlined, this should fix the warning. (cherry picked from "

"find_package module in CMake had a compatibility mode where it would "
"automatically search for packages in a <prefix>/lib subdirectory. In CMake "
"3.6, this compatibility mode was reverted for all platforms *except* "
"Windows. That means that since CMake 3.3, we haven't actually been using the "
"path as specified in ``curl_DIR``, but we have instead been inadvertently "
"relying on that fallback behavior. In CMake 3.28, that compatibilty mode was "
"also removed for Windows, meaning that we are now failing to "
"find_package(curl) in downstream packages (like resource_retriever). Fix "
"this by adding in the \"lib\" directory that always should have been there.  "
"I'll note that this *only* affects our Windows builds, because this code is "

"Callback after cancel (`#2281 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/"
