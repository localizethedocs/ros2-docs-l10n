"Some platforms have tools for creating basic packages that do not require a "

"not include support for ROS packaging tools and is platform dependent but "
"requires much less infrastructure to produce if you are creating collections "
"of existing packages rather than a mix of public and private ROS packages. "
"For example, on Debian or Ubuntu systems you can use the ``equivs`` "
"utilities. The Debian Administrator's handbook has a `Section on meta-"
