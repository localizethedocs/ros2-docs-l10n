"A ROS 2 system typically consists of many nodes running across many "
"different processes (and even different machines). While it is possible to "
"run each of these nodes separately, it gets cumbersome quite quickly."

"The launch system in ROS 2 is meant to automate the running of many nodes "
"with a single command. It helps the user describe the configuration of their "
"system and then executes it as described. The configuration of the system "
"includes what programs to run, where to run them, what arguments to pass "
"them, and ROS-specific conventions which make it easy to reuse components "
"throughout the system by giving them each a different configuration. It is "
"also responsible for monitoring the state of the processes launched, and "
"reporting and/or reacting to changes in the state of those processes."

"All of the above is specified in a launch file, which can be written in "
"Python, XML, or YAML. This launch file can then be run using the ``ros2 "
"launch`` command, and all of the nodes specified will be run."
