"When designing a system there are three primary styles of interfaces. The "
"specifications for the content is in the :doc:`Interfaces Overview <../"
"Concepts/Basic/About-Interfaces>`. This is written to provide the reader "
"with guidelines about when to use each type of interface."

"Should be used for remote procedure calls that terminate quickly, e.g. for "
"querying the state of a node or doing a quick calculation such as IK. They "
"should never be used for longer running processes, in particular processes "
"that might be required to preempt if exceptional situations occur and they "
"should never change or depend on state to avoid unwanted side effects for "
"other nodes."
