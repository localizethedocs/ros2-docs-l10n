"Many ROS packages are provided as pre-built binaries. Usually, you will get "
"the released version of binaries when following :doc:`../Installation`. "
"There are also pre-released versions of binaries that are useful for testing "
"before making an official release. This article describes several options if "
"you would like to try out pre-released versions of ROS binaries."

"When packages are released into a ROS distribution (using bloom), the "
"buildfarm builds them into deb packages which are stored temporarily in the "
"**building** apt repository. As dependent packages are rebuilt, an automatic "
"process periodically synchronizes the packages in **building** to a "
"secondary repository called **ros-testing**. **ros-testing** is intended as "
"a soaking area where developers and bleeding-edge users may give the "
"packages extra testing, before they are manually synced into the public ros "
"repository from which users typically install packages."
