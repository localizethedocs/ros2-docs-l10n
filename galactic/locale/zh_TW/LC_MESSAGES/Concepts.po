"A node is a participant in the ROS graph. ROS nodes use a ROS client library "
"to communicate with other nodes. Nodes can publish or subscribe to Topics. "
"Nodes can also provide or use Services and Actions. There are configurable "
"Parameters associated with a node. Connections between nodes are established "
"through a distributed discovery process. Nodes may be located in the same "
"process, in different processes, or on different machines. These concepts "
"will be described in more detail in the sections that follow."

#: ../../../source/Concepts.rst:73
msgid ""
"ROS client libraries allow nodes written in different programming languages "
"to communicate. There is a core ROS client library (RCL) that implements "
"common functionality needed for the ROS APIs of different languages. This "
"makes it so that language-specific client libraries are easier to write and "
"that they have more consistent behavior."

"Discovery of nodes happens automatically through the underlying middleware "

#: ../../../source/Concepts.rst:92
msgid ""
"When a node is started, it advertises its presence to other nodes on the "
"network with the same ROS domain (set with the ROS_DOMAIN_ID environment "
"variable). Nodes respond to this advertisement with information about "
"themselves so that the appropriate connections can be made and the nodes can "
"communicate."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/Concepts.rst:94
msgid ""
"Nodes periodically advertise their presence so that connections can be made "
"with new-found entities, even after the initial discovery period."

msgid ""
"Take the :ref:`talker-listener demo <talker-listener>` for example. Running "
"the C++ talker node in one terminal will publish messages on a topic, and "
"the Python listener node running in another terminal  will subscribe to "
"messages on the same topic."
