"Several robot simulators can be used with ROS 2, such as Gazebo, Ignition, "
"Webots, etc. Unlike turtlesim, they provide fairly realistic results relying "
"on physics-based models for robots, sensors, actuators and objects. Hence, "
"what you observe in simulation is very close to what you will get when "
"transferring your ROS 2 controllers to a real robot. In this tutorial, you "
"are going to use the Webots robot simulator to set-up and run a very simple "
"ROS 2 simulation scenario."
