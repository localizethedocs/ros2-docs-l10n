"Assume 'good faith': It's easy to mis-interpret the meaning or tone of "

"Please don't send your question more than once: The question was seen. If "

"Alternatively, it could be that nobody knows the answer. In any case, "
"sending it again is poor form and akin to shouting and is likely to "
"aggravate a large number of people. This also applies to crossposting. Try "
