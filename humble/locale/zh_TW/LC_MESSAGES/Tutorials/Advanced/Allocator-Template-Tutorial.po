"By default, many C++ standard library structures will implicitly allocate "
"memory as they grow, such as ``std::vector``. However, these data structures "
"also accept an \"Allocator\" template argument. If you specify a custom "
"allocator to one of these data structures, it will use that allocator for "
"you instead of the system allocator to grow or shrink the data structure. "
"Your custom allocator could have a pool of memory preallocated on the stack, "
"which might be better suited to real-time applications."

"In the ROS 2 C++ client library (rclcpp), we are following a similar "
"philosophy to the C++ standard library. Publishers, subscribers, and the "
"executor accept an allocator template parameter that controls allocations "

"The C++11 library provides something called ``allocator_traits``. The C++11 "
"standard specifies that a custom allocator only needs to fulfil a minimal "
"set of requirements to be used to allocate and deallocate memory in a "
"standard way. ``allocator_traits`` is a generic structure that fills out "
"other qualities of an allocator based on an allocator written with the "
"minimal requirements."
