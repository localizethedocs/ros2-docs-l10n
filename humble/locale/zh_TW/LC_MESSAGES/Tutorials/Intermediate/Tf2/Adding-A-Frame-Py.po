"In previous tutorials, we recreated the turtle demo by writing a :doc:`tf2 "
"broadcaster <./Writing-A-Tf2-Broadcaster-Py>` and a :doc:`tf2 listener <./"
"Writing-A-Tf2-Listener-Py>`. This tutorial will teach you how to add extra "
"fixed and dynamic frames to the transformation tree. In fact, adding a frame "
"in tf2 is very similar to creating the tf2 broadcaster, but this example "
"will show you some additional features of tf2."

"For many tasks related to transformations, it is easier to think inside a "
"local frame. For example, it is easiest to reason about laser scan "
"measurements in a frame at the center of the laser scanner. tf2 allows you "
"to define a local frame for each sensor, link, or joint in your system. When "
"transforming from one frame to another, tf2 will take care of all the hidden "
"intermediate frame transformations that are introduced."

"tf2 builds up a tree structure of frames and, thus, does not allow a closed "
"loop in the frame structure. This means that a frame only has one single "
"parent, but it can have multiple children. Currently, our tf2 tree contains "
"three frames: ``world``, ``turtle1`` and ``turtle2``. The two turtle frames "
"are children of the ``world`` frame. If we want to add a new frame to tf2, "
"one of the three existing frames needs to be the parent frame, and the new "
"one will become its child frame."
