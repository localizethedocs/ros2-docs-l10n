msgid ""
"ROS 2 uses a distributed discovery process for nodes to connect to each "
"other. As this process purposefully does not use a centralized discovery "
"mechanism, it can take time for ROS nodes to discover all other participants "
"in the ROS graph. To address this, ROS 2 runs a background daemon process "
"that maintains information about the ROS graph to provide faster responses "
"to queries, such as the list of node names."

msgid ""
"The ROS 2 daemon is automatically started when you first use command-line "
"tools like ``ros2 node list``, ``ros2 topic list``, or other introspection "
"commands. If no daemon is running, these tools will instantiate a new daemon "
"process in the background before executing the requested command."

"The daemon communicates using the localhost network interface (127.0.0.1) "
"and uses the :doc:`ROS_DOMAIN_ID <../Intermediate/About-Domain-ID>` "
"environment variable as a port number offset. This means that if you want to "
"control a specific daemon instance (for example, using ``ros2 daemon "
"stop``), you must ensure that your :doc:`ROS_DOMAIN_ID <../Intermediate/"
"About-Domain-ID>` matches the domain ID used by that daemon. Different :doc:"
"`ROS_DOMAIN_ID <../Intermediate/About-Domain-ID>` values will result in "
"separate daemon instances running on different ports."
