"A node is a participant in the ROS 2 graph, which uses a :doc:`client "
"library <About-Client-Libraries>` to communicate with other nodes. Nodes can "
"communicate with other nodes within the same process, in a different "
"process, or on a different machine. Nodes are typically the unit of "
"computation in a ROS graph; each node should do one logical thing."

"Nodes can :doc:`publish <About-Topics>` to named topics to deliver data to "
"other nodes, or :doc:`subscribe <About-Topics>` to named topics to get data "
"from other nodes. They can also act as a :doc:`service client <About-"
"Services>` to have another node perform a computation on their behalf, or as "
"a :doc:`service server <About-Services>` to provide functionality to other "
"nodes. For long-running computations, a node can act as an :doc:`action "
"client <About-Actions>` to have another node perform it on their behalf, or "
"as an :doc:`action server <About-Actions>` to provide functionality to other "
"nodes. Nodes can provide configurable :doc:`parameters <About-Parameters>` "
"to change behavior during run-time."
