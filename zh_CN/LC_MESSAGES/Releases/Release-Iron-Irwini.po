#: ../../../source/Releases/Release-Iron-Irwini.rst:74
msgid ""
"This specifically applies to the default ``spdlog`` based logging backend in "
"ROS 2, implemented in ``rcl_logging_spdlog``. Log file flushing was changed "
"to flush every time an \"error\" log message is used, e.g. each "
"``RCLCPP_ERROR()`` call, and also periodically every five seconds."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/Releases/Release-Iron-Irwini.rst:77

"Previously, ``spdlog`` was used without configuring anything other than "
"creating the sink for logging to a file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/Releases/Release-Iron-Irwini.rst:79
msgid ""
"We tested the change and did not find that the CPU overhead was significant, "
"even on machines with slow disks (e.g. sd cards). However, if this change is "
"causing you problems, you can get the old behavior by setting the "
"``RCL_LOGGING_SPDLOG_EXPERIMENTAL_OLD_FLUSHING_BEHAVIOR=1`` environment "
"variable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/Releases/Release-Iron-Irwini.rst:82
msgid ""
"Later we would like to have support for a full configuration file (see: "
"https://github.com/ros2/rcl_logging/issues/92), giving you more flexibility "
"in how the logging is done, but that is work that is only planned right now."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/Releases/Release-Iron-Irwini.rst:84

"Therefore, **this environment variable should be considered experimental and "
"subject to removal without deprecation in the future**, when we add config "
