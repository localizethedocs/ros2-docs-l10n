"In ROS 2, a service refers to a remote procedure call. In other words, a "
"node can make a remote procedure call to another node which will do a "
"computation and return a result."

"In ROS 2, services are expected to return quickly, as the client is "
"generally waiting on the result. Services should never be used for longer "
"running processes, in particular processes that might need to be preempted "
"for exceptional situations. If you have a service that will be doing a long-"
"running computation, consider using an :doc:`action <About-Actions>` instead."

"Services are identified by a service name, which looks much like a topic "

"A service server is the entity that will accept a remote procedure request, "
"and perform some computation on it. For instance, suppose the ROS 2 message "
"contains the following:"

"There should only ever be one service server per service name. It is "

#: ../../../source/Concepts/Basic/About-Services.rst:49
msgid ""
"A service client is an entity that will request a remote service server to "
"perform a computation on its behalf. Following from the example above, the "
"service client is the entity that creates the initial message containing "
"``a`` and ``b``, and waits for the service server to compute the sum and "
"return the result."
