"With the introduction of DDS in ROS 2, Quality of Service (QoS) "
"compatibility for publisher/subscriber nodes needs to be considered when "
"recording and playing back data. More detail on how QoS works can be found :"
"doc:`here <../Concepts/About-Quality-of-Service-Settings>`. For the purposes "
"of this guide, it is sufficient to know that only the reliability and "
"durability policies affect whether publishers/subscribers are compatible and "
"can receive data from one other."

"Ros2Bag adapts its requested/offered QoS profile when recording/playing data "
"from a topic to prevent dropped messages. During playback, Ros2bag also "
"attempts to preserve the policy originally offered by the topic. Certain "
"situations may require specifying explicit QoS profile settings so Ros2Bag "
"can record/playback topics. These QoS profile overrides can be specified via "
"the CLI using the ``--qos-profile-overrides-path`` flag."
