"Once you've determined that a ROS Wiki page is worth migrating, and found an "

"page to the ROS Docs are the `PanDoc <https://pandoc.org/>`_ command line "
"tool and a text editor. PanDoc is supported by most modern operating systems "
"using the installation instruction found on their website. It is worth "
"noting that the ROS Wiki uses an older wiki technology (MoinMoin), so the "
"markup language used is an obscure dialect of the `MediaWiki <https://www."
