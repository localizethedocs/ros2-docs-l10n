"``ros2 bag`` is a command line tool for recording data published on topics "
"in your system. It accumulates the data passed on any number of topics and "
"saves it in a database. You can then replay the data to reproduce the "
"results of your tests and experiments. Recording topics is also a great way "
"to share your work and allow others to recreate it."
