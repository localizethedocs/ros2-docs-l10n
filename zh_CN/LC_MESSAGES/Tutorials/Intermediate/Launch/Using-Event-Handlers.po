"Launch in ROS 2 is a system that executes and manages user-defined "
"processes. It is responsible for monitoring the state of processes it "
"launched, as well as reporting and reacting to changes in the state of those "
"processes. These changes are called events and can be handled by registering "
"an event handler with the launch system. Event handlers can be registered "
"for specific events and can be useful for monitoring the state of processes. "
"Additionally, they can be used to define a complex set of rules which can be "
"used to dynamically modify the launch file."
