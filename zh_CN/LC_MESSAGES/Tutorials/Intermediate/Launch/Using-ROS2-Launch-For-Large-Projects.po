"This tutorial describes some tips for writing launch files for large "

"reused as much as possible in different situations. Additionally, it covers "
"usage examples of different ROS 2 launch tools, like parameters, YAML files, "
"remappings, namespaces, default arguments, and RViz configs."

"Large applications on a robot typically involve several interconnected "
"nodes, each of which can have many parameters. Simulation of multiple "
"turtles in the turtle simulator can serve as a good example. The turtle "
"simulation consists of multiple turtle nodes, the world configuration, and "
"the TF broadcaster and listener nodes. Between all of the nodes, there are a "
"large number of ROS parameters that affect the behavior and appearance of "
"these nodes. ROS 2 launch files allow us to start all nodes and set "
"corresponding parameters in one place. By the end of a tutorial, you will "
"build the ``launch_turtlesim_launch`` launch file in the ``launch_tutorial`` "
"package. This launch file will bring up different nodes responsible for the "
"simulation of two turtlesim simulations, starting TF broadcasters and "
"listener, loading parameters, and launching an RViz configuration. In this "
"tutorial, we'll go over this launch file and all related features used."

"Launch files can be written in XML, YAML, or Python format. Throughout this "
"tutorial, launch files are shown in all three formats using tabs. You can "
"choose whichever format you prefer - they are functionally equivalent. "
"Wherever you see the file name ``launch_turtlesim_launch`` make sure to use "
"the correct file extension for your launch file type (i.e. "
"``launch_turtlesim_launch.py`` for Python, ``launch_turtlesim_launch.xml`` "
"for XML, and ``launch_turtlesim_launch.yaml`` for YAML."

"One of the aims in the process of writing launch files should be making them "
"as reusable as possible. This could be done by clustering related nodes and "
"configurations into separate launch files. Afterwards, a top-level launch "
"file dedicated to a specific configuration could be written. This would "
"allow moving between identical robots to be done without changing the launch "
"files at all. Even a change such as moving from a real robot to a simulated "
"one can be done with only a few changes."
