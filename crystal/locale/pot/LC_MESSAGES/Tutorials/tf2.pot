"There is preliminary support for `tf2 <https://wiki.ros.org/tf2>`__ in ROS "
"2. We rely heavily on tf2 in ROS 1 to manage data about coordinate "
"transforms, and we expect to continue to use extensively in ROS 2."

"Here's how to try it out. In each shell, be sure to start by sourcing the "
"ROS 2 setup file as usual (e.g. on Linux ``. ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash`` "
"or on Windows ``call C:\\dev\\ros2\\install\\setup.bat``)."
