"With the introduction of DDS in ROS2, Quality of Service (QoS) compatibility "
"for publisher/subscriber nodes needs to be considered when recording and "
"playing back data. More detail on how QoS works can be found `here <https://"
"index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Concepts/About-Quality-of-Service-Settings>`__. For "
"the purposes of this tutorial, it is sufficient to know that only the "
"reliability and durability policies affect whether publishers/subscribers "
"are compatible and can receive data from one other. Ros2Bag adapts its "
"requested/offered QoS profile when recording/playing data from a topic to "
"prevent dropped messages. During playback, Ros2bag also attempts to preserve "
"the policy originally offered by the topic. Certain situations may require "
"specifying explicit QoS profile settings so Ros2Bag can record/playback "
"topics. These QoS profile overrides can be specified via the CLI using the "
"``--qos-profile-overrides-path`` flag."

"If a policy value is not specified, the value will fallback to the default "
"used by Ros2Bag. If you specify a Duration based policy such as ``deadline`` "
"or ``lifespan``, you will need to specify both seconds and nanoseconds. "
"Policy values are determined by the policyâ€™s short keys which can be found "
"using ``ros2topic`` verbs such as ``ros2 topic pub --help``. All values are "
