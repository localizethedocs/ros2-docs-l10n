RMW implementations
===================

By default, ROS 2 uses DDS as its `middleware <https://design.ros2.org/articles/ros_on_dds.html>`__.
It is compatible with multiple DDS or RTPS (the DDS wire protocol) vendors.
There is currently support for eProsima's Fast DDS, RTI's Connext DDS, Eclipse Cyclone DDS, and GurumNetworks GurumDDS.

It also supports non DDS RMW implementations such as Zenoh.

See `REP-2000 <https://reps.openrobotics.org/rep-2000/>`__ for supported RMW vendors by distribution.

The default RMW vendor is eProsima's Fast DDS.
