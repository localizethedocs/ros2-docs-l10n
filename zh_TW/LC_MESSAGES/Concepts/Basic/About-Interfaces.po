"ROS applications typically communicate through interfaces of one of three "
"types: :doc:`topics <About-Topics>`, :doc:`services <About-Services>`, or :"
"doc:`actions <About-Actions>`. ROS 2 uses a simplified description language, "
"the interface definition language (IDL), to describe these interfaces. This "
"description makes it easy for ROS tools to automatically generate source "
"code for the interface type in several target languages."
