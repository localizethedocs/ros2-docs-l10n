"Parameters in ROS 2 are associated with individual nodes. Parameters are "
"used to configure nodes at startup (and during runtime), without changing "
"the code. The lifetime of a parameter is tied to the lifetime of the node "
"(though the node could implement some sort of persistence to reload values "
"after restart)."

"Parameters are addressed by node name, node namespace, parameter name, and "
"parameter namespace. Providing a parameter namespace is optional."

"Each parameter consists of a key, a value, and a descriptor. The key is a "
"string and the value is one of the following types: ``bool``, ``int64``, "
"``float64``, ``string``, ``byte[]``, ``bool[]``, ``int64[]``, ``float64[]`` "
"or ``string[]``. By default all descriptors are empty, but can contain "
"parameter descriptions, value ranges, type information, and additional "
"constraints."

"By default, a node needs to *declare* all of the parameters that it will "
"accept during its lifetime. This is so that the type and name of the "
"parameters are well-defined at node startup time, which reduces the chances "
"of misconfiguration later on. See :doc:`../../Tutorials/Beginner-Client-"

"For some types of nodes, not all of the parameters will be known ahead of "
"time. In these cases, the node can be instantiated with "
"``allow_undeclared_parameters`` set to ``true``, which will allow parameters "
"to be get and set on the node even if they haven't been declared."

"Each parameter on a ROS 2 node has one of the pre-defined parameter types as "
"mentioned in the Overview. By default, attempts to change the type of a "
"declared parameter at runtime will fail. This prevents common mistakes, such "
"as putting a boolean value into an integer parameter."

msgid ""
"If a parameter needs to be multiple different types, and the code using the "
"parameter can handle it, this default behavior can be changed. When the "
"parameter is declared, it should be declared using a ``ParameterDescriptor`` "
"with the ``dynamic_typing`` member variable set to ``true``."

"A ROS 2 node can register three different types of callbacks to be informed "
"when changes are happening to parameters. All three of the callbacks are "
"optional."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/Concepts/Basic/About-Parameters.rst:57
msgid ""
"The first is known as a \"pre set parameter\" callback, and can be set by "
"calling ``add_pre_set_parameters_callback`` from the node API. This callback "
"is passed a list of the ``Parameter`` objects that are being changed, and "
"returns nothing. When it is called, it can modify the ``Parameter`` list to "
"change, add, or remove entries. As an example, if ``parameter2`` should "
"change anytime that ``parameter1`` changes, that can be implemented with "
"this callback."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/Concepts/Basic/About-Parameters.rst:62
msgid ""
"The second is known as a \"set parameter\" callback, and can be set by "
"calling ``add_on_set_parameters_callback`` from the node API. The callback "
"is passed a list of immutable ``Parameter`` objects, and returns an "
"``rcl_interfaces/msg/SetParametersResult``. The main purpose of this "
"callback is to give the user the ability to inspect the upcoming change to "
"the parameter and explicitly reject the change."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/Concepts/Basic/About-Parameters.rst:67
msgid ""
"It is important that \"set parameter\" callbacks have no side-effects. Since "
"multiple \"set parameter\" callbacks can be chained, there is no way for an "
"individual callback to know if a later callback will reject the update. If "
"the individual callback were to make changes to the class it is in, for "
"instance, it may get out-of-sync with the actual parameter. To get a "
"callback *after* a parameter has been successfully changed, see the next "
"type of callback below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/Concepts/Basic/About-Parameters.rst:72
msgid ""
"The third type of callback is known as an \"post set parameter\" callback, "
"and can be set by calling ``add_post_set_parameters_callback`` from the node "
"API. The callback is passed a list of immutable ``Parameter`` objects, and "
"returns nothing. The main purpose of this callback is to give the user the "
"ability to react to changes from parameters that have successfully been "
"accepted."
