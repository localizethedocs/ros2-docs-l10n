"In \"classic\" CMake a package provides CMake variables like "

"``ament_export_include_directories`` and ``ament_export_libraries``. In "

"all include directories and libraries of recursive dependencies are "
"concatenated and included in these variables."

"In \"modern\" CMake a package provides an interface target instead (commonly "
"named ``<pkgname>::<pkgname>``) which in itself encapsulates all recursive "
"dependencies. In order to export a library target to use modern CMake "
"``ament_export_targets`` needs to be called with an export name which is "
"also used when installing the libraries using ``install(TARGETS <libA> "
"<libB> EXPORT <export_name> ...)``. The exported interface targets are "
"available through the CMake variable ``<pkgname>_TARGETS``. For library "
"targets to be exportable like this they must not rely on classic functions "
"affecting global state like ``include_directories()`` but set the include "
"directories on the target itself - for the build as well as install "
"environment - using generator expressions, e.g. "
"``target_include_directories(<target> PUBLIC \"$<BUILD_INTERFACE:"

"As of Foxy, domain participants are no longer mapped directly to ROS nodes. "
"As a result, ROS 2 security features (which are specific to domain "
"participants) are also no longer mapped directly to ROS nodes. Instead, Foxy "
