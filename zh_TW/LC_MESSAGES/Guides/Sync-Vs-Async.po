"This guide is intended to warn users of the risks associated with the Python "
"synchronous service client ``call()`` API. It is very easy to mistakenly "
"cause deadlock when calling services synchronously, so we do not recommend "
"using ``call()``."

"We provide an example on how to use ``call()`` correctly for experienced "

"A synchronous client will block the calling thread when sending a request to "
"a service until a response has been received; nothing else can happen on "
