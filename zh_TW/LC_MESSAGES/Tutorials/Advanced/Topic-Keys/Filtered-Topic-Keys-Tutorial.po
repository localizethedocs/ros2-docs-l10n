"In ROS 2, topics are a mean for representing the state of an object. Keyed "
"topics are special topics where each data sample represent an update of the "
"state of a specific object (known as *instance*) among all those objects "
"represented in the topic. This allows the user to reduce the number of "
"required resources (topics, along with its associated publisher and "
"subscriber) by multiplexing updates of several objects of the same kind into "
"a single resource."

msgid ""
"The :doc:`Content Filter Topic <../../Demos/Content-Filtering-Subscription>` "
"facilitates efficient data distribution by allowing the subscription (reader-"
"side) to specify criteria for the types of data they wish to receive. By "
"defining this criteria, irrelevant data can be filtered out and applications "
"can focus only on the information that is relevant to their needs. This "
"functionality not only reduces the amount of data transmitted over the "
"network but also minimizes processing overhead on the receiving end, leading "
"to improved system performance and scalability."

#: ../../../source/Tutorials/Advanced/Topic-Keys/Filtered-Topic-Keys-Tutorial.rst:24
msgid ""
"When combined with topic instances, the benefits of the Content Filter are "
"further enhanced. By associating specific filter criteria with each topic "
"instance, it is possible fine-tune the data selection process and tailor it "
"to their precise requirements. This granular level of filtering enables "
"applications to optimally manage data while ensuring that they exchange only "
"the information that is pertinent to their individual use cases."
