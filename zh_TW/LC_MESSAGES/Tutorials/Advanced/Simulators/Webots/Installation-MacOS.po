"The ``webots_ros2`` package provides an interface between ROS 2 and Webots. "
"It includes several sub-packages, including ``webots_ros2_driver``, which "
"allows you to start Webots and communicate with it. Other sub-packages are "
"mainly examples that show multiple possible implementations using the "
"interface. In this tutorial, you are going to install the package and learn "
"how to run one of these examples."

"On macOS, a solution based on UTM virtual machines provides an improved user "
"experience with ROS 2 compared to native macOS installation, as it runs ROS "
"in a Linux environment. However, Webots should be installed natively on "
"macOS and it will be able to communicate with the ROS nodes running in the "
"Virtual Machine (VM). This solution allows for native 3D hardware "
"acceleration for Webots. The VM runs all the ROS part (including RViz) and "
"connects to the host machine through TCP to start Webots. A shared folder "
"allows the script to transfer the world and other resource files from the VM "
