"In this tutorial, you used the ``call_async()`` API in your client node to "
"call the service. There is another service call API available for Python "
"called synchronous calls. We do not recommend using synchronous calls, but "
"if you'd like to learn more about them, read the guide to :doc:`Synchronous "
"vs. asynchronous clients <../../How-To-Guides/Sync-Vs-Async>`."
