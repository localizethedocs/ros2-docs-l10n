"This page provides some guidance on parameter tunings that were found to "
"address issues faced while using various DDS implementations on Linux in "
"real-world situations. It is possible that the issues we identified on Linux "
"or while using one vendor may occur for other platforms and vendors not "
"documented here."

"The recommendations below are starting points for tuning; they worked for "
"specific systems and environments, but the tuning may vary depending on a "
"number of factors. You may need to increase or decrease values while "
"debugging relative to factors like message size, network topology, etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/Guides/DDS-tuning.rst:14
msgid ""
"It is important to recognize that tuning parameters can come at a cost to "
"resources, and may affect parts of your system beyond the scope of the "
"desired improvements. The benefits of improving reliability should be "
"weighed against any detriments for each individual case."

"**Issue:** Sending data over lossy (usually WiFi) connections becomes "
"problematic when some IP fragments are dropped, possibly causing the kernel "
"buffer on the receiving side to become full."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/Guides/DDS-tuning.rst:24
msgid ""
"When a UDP packet is missing at least one IP fragment, the rest of the "
"received fragments fill up the kernel buffer. By default, the Linux kernel "
"will time out after 30s of trying to recombine packet fragments. Since the "
"kernel buffer is full at this point (default size is 256KB), no new "
"fragments can come in, and so the connection will seemingly \"hang\" for "
"long periods of time."

#: ../../../source/Guides/DDS-tuning.rst:28
msgid ""
"This issue is generic across all DDS vendors, so the solutions involve "
"adjusting kernel parameters."

msgid "**Solution:** Use best-effort QoS settings instead of reliable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/Guides/DDS-tuning.rst:32
msgid ""
"Best-effort settings reduce the amount of network traffic since the DDS "
"implementation does not have to incur the overhead of reliable "
"communications, where publishers require acknowledgements for messages sent "
"to subscribers and must resend samples that have not been properly received."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/Guides/DDS-tuning.rst:34
msgid ""
"If the kernel buffer for IP fragments gets full, though, the symptom is "
"still the same (blocking for 30s). This solution should improve the issue "
"somewhat without having to adjust parameters."

"Significantly increasing this parameter’s value is an attempt to ensure that "
