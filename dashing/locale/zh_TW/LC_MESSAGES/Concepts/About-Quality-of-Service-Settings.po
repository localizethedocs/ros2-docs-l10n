"ROS 2 offers a rich variety of Quality of Service (QoS) policies that allow "
"you to tune communication between nodes. With the right set of Quality of "
"Service policies, ROS 2 can be as reliable as TCP or as best-effort as UDP, "
"with many, many possible states in between. Unlike ROS 1, which primarily "
"only supported TCP, ROS 2 benefits from the flexibility of the underlying "
"DDS transport in environments with lossy wireless networks where a “best "
"effort” policy would be more suitable, or in real-time computing systems "
"where the right Quality of Service profile is needed to meet deadlines."

"A set of QoS “policies” combine to form a QoS “profile”. Given the "

"specific policies of the QoS profiles."
