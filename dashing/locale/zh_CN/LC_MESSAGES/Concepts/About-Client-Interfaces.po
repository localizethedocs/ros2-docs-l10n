"The ROS Client Library for C++ (``rclcpp``) is the user facing, C++ "
"idiomatic interface which provides all of the ROS client functionality like "
"creating nodes, publisher, and subscribers. ``rclcpp`` builds on top of "
"``rcl`` and the ``rosidl`` |API|, and it is designed to be used with the C++ "
"messages generated by ``rosidl_generator_cpp``."

"``rclcpp`` makes use of all the features of C++ and C++11 to make the "
"interface as easy to use as possible, but since it reuses the implementation "
"in ``rcl`` it is able maintain a consistent behavior with the other client "
"libraries that use the ``rcl`` |API|."

"The ROS Client Library for Python (``rclpy``) is the Python counterpart to "
"the C++ client library. Like the C++ client library, ``rclpy`` also builds "
"on top of the ``rcl`` C API for its implementation. The interface provides "
"an idiomatic Python experience which uses native Python types and patterns "
"like lists and context objects, but by using the ``rcl`` |API| in the "
"implementation it stays consistent with the other client libraries in terms "
"of feature parity and behavior. In addition to providing Python idiomatic "
"bindings around the ``rcl`` |API| and Python classes for each message, the "
"Python client library takes care of the execution model, using ``threading."
"Thread`` or similar to run the functions in the ``rcl`` |API|."

"Like C++ it generates custom Python code for each ROS message that the user "
"interacts with, but unlike C++ it eventually converts the native Python "
"message object into the C version of the message. All operations happen on "
"the Python version of the messages until they need to be passed into the "
"``rcl`` layer, at which point they are converted into the plain C version of "
"the message so it can be passed into the ``rcl`` C |API|. This is avoided if "
"possible when communicating between publishers and subscribers in the same "
"process to cut down on the conversion into and out of Python."
