"``rqt_console`` is a GUI tool used to introspect log messages in ROS 2. "
"Typically, log messages show up in your terminal. With ``rqt_console``, you "
"can collect those messages over time, view them closely and in a more "
"organized manner, filter them, save them and even reload the saved files to "
"introspect at a different time."

"Nodes use logs to output messages concerning events and statuses in a "
"variety of ways. Their content is usually informational, for the sake of the "
"user. The intent of a log message is defined by the author of the node, "
"though the content may be written at runtime."
