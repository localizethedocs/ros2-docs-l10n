"ROS 2 relies on the notion of combining workspaces using the shell "
"environment. \"Workspace\" is a ROS term for the location on your system "
"where you're developing with ROS 2. The core ROS 2 workspace is called the "
"underlay. Subsequent local workspaces are called overlays. When developing "
"with ROS 2, you will typically have several workspaces active concurrently."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../source/Tutorials/Configuring-ROS2-Environment.rst:25
msgid ""
"Combining workspaces makes developing against different versions of ROS 2, "
"or against different sets of packages, easier. It also allows the "
"installation of several ROS 2 distributions (or “distros”, e.g. Dashing and "
"Eloquent) on the same computer and switching between them."

"This is accomplished by sourcing setup files every time you open a new "
