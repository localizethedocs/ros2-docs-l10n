"ROS 2 is built on top of DDS/RTPS as its middleware, which provides "
"discovery, serialization and transportation. `This article <https://design."
"ros2.org/articles/ros_on_dds.html>`__ explains the motivation behind using "
"DDS implementations, and/or the RTPS wire protocol of DDS, in detail. In "
"summary, DDS is an end-to-end middleware that provides features which are "
"relevant to ROS systems, such as distributed discovery (not centralized like "
"in ROS 1) and control over different \"Quality of Service\" options for the "
"transportation."

"`DDS <http://portals.omg.org/dds/>`__ is an industry standard which is "
"implemented by a range of vendors, such as RTI's implementation `Connext "
"<https://www.rti.com/products/>`__, ADLINK's implementation `OpenSplice "
"<https://github.com/ADLINK-IST/opensplice>`__ or `Eclipse's Cyclone DDS "
"<https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.cyclonedds>`__. RTPS (a.k.a. "
"`DDSI-RTPS <https://www.omg.org/spec/DDSI-RTPS/About-DDSI-RTPS/>`__\\ ) is "
"the wire protocol used by DDS to communicate over the network. There are "
"implementations of that which do not fulfill the full DDS API, but provide "
"sufficient functionality for ROS 2, such as eProsima's implementation `Fast "
"RTPS <http://www.eprosima.com/index.php/products-all/eprosima-fast-rtps>`__."

"ROS 2 supports multiple DDS/RTPS implementations because it is not "
"necessarily \"one size fits all\" when it comes to choosing a vendor/"
"implementation. There are many factors you might consider while choosing a "
"middleware implementation: logistical considerations like the license, or "
"technical considerations like platform availability, or computation "
"footprint. Vendors may provide more than one DDS or RTPS implementation "
"targeted at meeting different needs. For example, RTI has a few variations "
"of their Connext implementation that vary in purpose, like one that "
"specifically targets microcontrollers and another which targets applications "
"requiring special safety certifications (we only support their standard "
"desktop version at this time)."

"In order to use a DDS/RTPS implementation with ROS 2, a \"\\ **R**\\ OS "
"**M**\\ iddle\\ **w**\\ are interface\" (a.k.a. ``rmw`` interface or just "
"``rmw``\\ ) package needs to be created that implements the abstract ROS "
"middleware interface using the DDS or RTPS implementation's API and tools. "
"It's a lot of work to implement and maintain RMW packages for supporting DDS "
"implementations, but supporting at least a few implementations is important "
"for ensuring that the ROS 2 codebase is not tied to any one particular "
"implementation, as users may wish to switch out implementations depending on "
"their project's needs."
