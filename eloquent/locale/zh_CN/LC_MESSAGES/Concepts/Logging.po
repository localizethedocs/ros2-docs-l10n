"Each node (in ``rclcpp`` and ``rclpy``) has a logger associated with it that "
"automatically includes the node's name and namespace. If the node's name is "
"externally remapped to something other than what is defined in the source "

"created that use a specific name."

"Logger names represent a hierarchy. If the level of a logger named \"abc."
"def\" is unset, it will defer to the level of its parent named \"abc\", and "
"if that level is also unset, the default logger level will be used. When the "
"level of logger \"abc\" is changed, all of its descendants (e.g. \"abc."
"def\", \"abc.ghi.jkl\") will have their level impacted unless their level "
"has been explicitly set."
