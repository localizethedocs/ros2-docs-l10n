"ROS 2 uses a distributed discovery process for nodes to connect to each "
"other. As this process purposefully does not use a centralized discovery "
"mechanism (like the ROS Master in ROS 1), it can take time for ROS nodes to "
"discover all other participants in the ROS graph. Because of this, there is "
"a long-running daemon in the background that stores information about the "
"ROS graph to provide faster responses to queries, e.g. the list of node "
"names."
