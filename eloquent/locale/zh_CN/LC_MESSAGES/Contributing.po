"next ROS 2 release (the milestone will be the next release's codename e.g. "
"'crystal')."

"`on the ROS 2 forum <https://discourse.ros.org/c/ng-ros>`__ before you start "
"to work on it so that you can identify if someone else is already working on "
"something similar. If your proposal involves changes to the APIs, it is "
