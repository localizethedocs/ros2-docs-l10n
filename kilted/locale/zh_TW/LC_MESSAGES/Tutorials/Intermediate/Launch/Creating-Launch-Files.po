"The launch system in ROS 2 is responsible for helping the user describe the "

"configuration of the system includes what programs to run, where to run "
"them, what arguments to pass them, and ROS-specific conventions which make "
"it easy to reuse components throughout the system by giving them each a "
"different configuration. It is also responsible for monitoring the state of "
