"In previous tutorials, we recreated the turtle demo by writing a :doc:`tf2 "
"broadcaster <Writing-A-Tf2-Broadcaster-Cpp>` and a :doc:`tf2 listener "
"<Writing-A-Tf2-Listener-Cpp>`. We also learned how to :doc:`add a new frame "
"to the transformation tree <Adding-A-Frame-Cpp>` and learned how tf2 keeps "
"track of a tree of coordinate frames. This tree changes over time, and tf2 "
"stores a time snapshot for every transform (for up to 10 seconds by "
"default). Until now we used the ``lookupTransform()`` function to get access "
"to the latest available transforms in that tf2 tree, without knowing at what "
"time that transform was recorded. This tutorial will teach you how to get a "
"transform at a specific time."
