"This guide is intended to warn users of the risks associated with the Python "
"synchronous service client ``call()`` API. It is very easy to mistakenly "
"cause deadlock when calling services synchronously, so we do not recommend "
"using ``call()``."

"We provide an example on how to use ``call()`` correctly for experienced "

"A synchronous client will block the calling thread when sending a request to "

"It is not recommended to implement a synchronous service client. They are "
"susceptible to deadlock, but will not provide any indication of issue when "
"deadlock occurs. If you must use synchronous calls, the example in section "
"`1 Synchronous calls`_ is a safe method of doing so. You should also be "
"aware of the conditions that cause deadlock outlined in section `1.1 Sync "
"deadlock`_. We recommend using async service clients instead."
