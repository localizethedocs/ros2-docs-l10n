"An API, or Application Programming Interface, is an interface that is "
"provided by an \"application\", which in this case is usually a shared "
"library or other language appropriate shared resource. APIs are made up of "
"files that define a contract between the software using the interface and "
"the software providing the interface. These files typically manifest as "
"header files in C and C++ and as Python files in Python. In either case it "
"is important that APIs are grouped and described in documentation and that "
"they are declared as either public or private. Public interfaces are subject "
"to change rules and changes to the public interfaces prompt a new version "
"number of the software that provides them."
