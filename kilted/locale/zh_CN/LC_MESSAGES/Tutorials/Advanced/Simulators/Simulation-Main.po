"Several advanced robot simulators can be used with ROS 2, such as Gazebo, "
"Webots, etc. Unlike turtlesim, they provide fairly realistic results relying "
"on physics-based models for robots, sensors, actuators and objects. Hence, "
"what you observe in simulation is very close to what you will get when "
"transferring your ROS 2 controllers to a real robot."
