"`rosdistro <https://github.com/ros/rosdistro>`_ contains the central index "
"of ROS packages for all distributions and ``rosdep`` keys for packaged "
"binary dependencies for installation. When you invoke ``rosdep install ..."
"``, it is checking a local cached index from rosdistro (populated during "
"``rosdep update``) to correlate keys in a ``package.xml`` to the ROS "
"package, python module, or binary to install. Thus, this index is an "
"important element of the ROS ecosystem."

"However, there are occasions where a user would like the assert further "
"control over this index to add in their own proprietary keys or use a "
"previous state of rosdistro. This guide walks through how to set a version "
"of rosdistro to use on your system."

"The motivating example that this guide will use is a desire to use a "
"previous version of Rolling due to a breakage on your development computer "
"or Continuous Integration. It is possible that during transition periods "
"from one operating system to another, Rolling on the older operating system "
"may become unusable due to support shifting to a new OS (i.e. moving from "
"Ubuntu 22.04 to 24.04). Thus, we wish to set a prior version of rosdistro "
"that aligns with a working Rolling distribution on a given operating system "
"to keep our systems functioning before upgrading to the new operating system."

"Rosdep populates its cache from the locations set in its ``/etc/ros/rosdep/"

"For our motivating example, we wish to use the last index state before the "

"last sync for our operating system was performed on February 28, 2024. "
"Conveniently, the syncs are tagged so we can obtain that information on the "

"Thus, we need to update the ``20-default.list`` with our tagged branch "

"may need to include ``sudo``. This will update list to use our tagged branch "
