"In ROS 2, a :doc:`Topic<../../../Concepts/Basic/About-Topics>` is a "
"communication channel used for publishing and subscribing to updates of "
"object states. The value of data associated with a topic changes over time "
"and each of these values are known as *data samples*. Keyed topics refer to "
"topics where each data sample represent an update of the state of a specific "
"object (known as *instance*) among all those objects represented in the "
"topic."

msgid ""
"Unlike standard topics, where each data sample updates the entire object "
"state with every data sample, keyed topics allow the user to reduce the "
"number of required resources (topics, along with its associated publisher "
"and subscriber) by multiplexing updates of several objects of the same kind "
"into a single resource."
