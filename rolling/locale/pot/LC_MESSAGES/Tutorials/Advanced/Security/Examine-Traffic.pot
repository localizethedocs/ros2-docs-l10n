"ROS 2 communications security is all about protecting communications between "

"traffic is being encrypted? In this tutorial we'll take a look at capturing "
"live network traffic to show the difference between encrypted and "

"endpoints are in the same host system. Security enclaves are still applied, "
"and data will be encrypted. However, you cannot capture live network traffic "
"since the data will not be on the network interface. If you are using  "
