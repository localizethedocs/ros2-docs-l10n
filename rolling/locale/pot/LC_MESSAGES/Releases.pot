"A ROS distribution is a versioned set of ROS packages. These are akin to "
"Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu). The purpose of the ROS distributions is "
"to let developers work against a relatively stable codebase until they are "
"ready to roll everything forward. Therefore once a distribution is released, "
"we try to limit changes to bug fixes and non-breaking improvements for the "
"core packages (every thing under ros-desktop-full). That generally applies "
"to the whole community, but for \"higher\" level packages, the rules are "
"less strict, and so it falls to the maintainers of a given package to avoid "
"breaking changes."
