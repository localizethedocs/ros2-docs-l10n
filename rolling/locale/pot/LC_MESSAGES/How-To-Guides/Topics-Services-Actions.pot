"Are for continuous data flow. Data might be published and subscribed at any "
"time independent of any senders/receivers. Many to many connection. "
"Callbacks receive data once it is available. The publisher decides when data "

"Should be used for remote procedure calls that terminate quickly, e.g. for "
"querying the state of a node or doing a quick calculation such as IK. They "
"should never be used for longer running processes, in particular processes "
"that might be required to preempt if exceptional situations occur and they "
"should never change or depend on state to avoid unwanted side effects for "
"other nodes."

"The most important property of actions is that they can be preempted and "
"preemption should always be implemented cleanly by action servers."

"Actions can keep state for the lifetime of a goal, i.e. if executing two "
"action goals in parallel on the same server, for each client a separate "
"state instance can be kept since the goal is uniquely identified by its id."

"More complex non-blocking background processing. Used for longer tasks like "
