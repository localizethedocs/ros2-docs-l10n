"ROS 2 is supported on both 32 bit (arm32) and 64 bit (arm64) ARM processors. "
"However, you can see `here <https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html>`__ that "
"arm64 receives Tier 1 support, while arm32 is Tier 3. Tier 1 support means "
"distribution specific packages and binary archives are available, while Tier "
"3 requires the user to compile ROS 2 from source."
