"``ros2 bag`` is a command line tool for recording data published on topics, "
"services and actions in your ROS 2 system. It accumulates the data passed on "
"any number of topics, services and actions, then saves it in a database. You "
"can then replay the data to reproduce the results of your tests and "
"experiments. Recording topics, services and actions is also a great way to "
"share your work and allow others to recreate it."
