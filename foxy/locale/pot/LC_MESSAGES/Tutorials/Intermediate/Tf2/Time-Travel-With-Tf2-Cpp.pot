"In the previous tutorial, we discussed the :doc:`basics of tf2 and time <./"
"Learning-About-Tf2-And-Time-Cpp>`. This tutorial will take us one step "
"further and expose a powerful tf2 trick: the time travel. In short, one of "
"the key features of tf2 library is that it is able to transform data in time "
"as well as in space."

"This tf2 time travel feature can be useful for various tasks, like "
"monitoring the pose of the robot for a long period of time or building a "
"follower robot that will follow the \"steps\" of the leader. We will use "
"that time travel feature to look up transforms back in time and program "
"``turtle2`` to follow 5 seconds behind ``carrot1``."
