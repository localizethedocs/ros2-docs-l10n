This page explains how to install ROS 2 on Windows from a pre-built binary package.

.. note::

    The pre-built binary does not include all ROS 2 packages.
    All packages in the `ROS base variant <https://reps.openrobotics.org/rep-2001/#ros-base>`_ are included, and only a subset of packages in the `ROS desktop variant <https://reps.openrobotics.org/rep-2001/#desktop-variants>`_ are included.
    The exact list of packages are described by the repositories listed in `this ros2.repos file <https://github.com/ros2/ros2/blob/{REPOS_FILE_BRANCH}/ros2.repos>`_.

System requirements
-------------------

Only Windows 10 is supported.

.. _windows-install-binary-installing-prerequisites:

Create a location for the ROS 2 installation
--------------------------------------------

This location will contain both the installed binary packages, plus the ROS 2 installation itself.

Start a powershell session (usually by clicking on the start menu, then typing ``powershell``).

Then create a directory to store the installation.
Because of Windows path-length limitations, this should be as short as possible.
We'll use ``C:\pixi_ws`` for the rest of these instructions.

.. code-block:: console

   $ md C:\pixi_ws

.. note::

    Note: the ROS 2 binary packages are currently not relocatable, which is being tracked in a `documentation issue <https://github.com/ros2/ros2_documentation/issues/5384>`__.
    Please use ``C:\pixi_ws`` in the interim.

Install prerequisites
---------------------

ROS 2 uses `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`__ as a backend for packages, with `pixi <https://pixi.sh/latest/>`__ as the frontend.

.. note::

   The installation of conda-forge may trigger Windows Defender to treat it as a threat, but this can be safely ignored by clicking "More info" and "Run anyway".

Install pixi
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Continue using the previous powershell session, and use the instructions on https://pixi.sh/latest/ to install ``pixi``.
Once ``pixi`` has been installed, close the powershell session and start it again, which will ensure ``pixi`` is on the PATH.

Install dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the pixi configuration file in the existing powershell session:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd C:\pixi_ws
   $ irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2/ros2/refs/heads/{REPOS_FILE_BRANCH}/pixi.toml -OutFile pixi.toml

Install dependencies:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pixi install

Install ROS 2
-------------

* Go to the releases page: https://github.com/ros2/ros2/releases
* Download the latest package for Windows, e.g., ``ros2-{DISTRO}-*-windows-release-amd64.zip``.

.. note::

   There may be more than one binary download option which might cause the file name to differ.

* Unpack the zip file somewhere (we'll assume ``C:\pixi_ws\ros2-windows``).

Install additional RMW implementations (optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default middleware that ROS 2 uses is ``Fast DDS``, but the middleware (RMW) can be replaced at runtime.
See the :doc:`guide <../How-To-Guides/Working-with-multiple-RMW-implementations>` on how to work with multiple RMWs.


Setup environment
-----------------

Start a new Windows command prompt, which will be used in the examples.

Source the pixi environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Source the pixi environment to set up dependencies:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd C:\pixi_ws
   $ pixi shell

Source the ROS 2 environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is required in every command prompt you open to setup the ROS 2 workspace:

.. code-block:: console

   $ call C:\pixi_ws\ros2-windows\local_setup.bat

If you do not have RTI Connext DDS installed on your computer, it is normal to receive a warning that it is missing.

Try some examples
-----------------

In a command prompt, set up the ROS 2 environment as described above and then run a C++ ``talker``\ :

.. code-block:: console

   $ ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker

Start another command shell and run a Python ``listener``\ :

.. code-block:: console

   $ ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener

You should see the ``talker`` saying that it's ``Publishing`` messages and the ``listener`` saying ``I heard`` those messages.
This verifies both the C++ and Python APIs are working properly.
Hooray!


Next steps
----------

Continue with the :doc:`tutorials and demos <../../Tutorials>` to configure your environment, create your own workspace and packages, and learn ROS 2 core concepts.

Troubleshoot
------------

Troubleshooting techniques can be found :ref:`here <windows-troubleshooting>`.

Uninstall
---------

1. If you installed your workspace with colcon as instructed above, "uninstalling" could be just a matter of opening a new terminal and not sourcing the workspace's ``setup`` file.
   This way, your environment will behave as though there is no {DISTRO_TITLE} install on your system.

2. If you're also trying to free up space, you can delete the entire workspace directory with:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ rmdir /s /q C:\pixi_ws
