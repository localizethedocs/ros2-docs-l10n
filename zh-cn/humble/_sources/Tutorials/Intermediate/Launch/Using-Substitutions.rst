Background
----------

Launch files are used to start nodes, services and execute processes.
This set of actions may have arguments, which affect their behavior.
Substitutions can be used in arguments to provide more flexibility when describing reusable launch files.
Substitutions are variables that are only evaluated during execution of the launch description and can be used to acquire specific information like a launch configuration, an environment variable, or to evaluate an arbitrary Python expression.

This tutorial shows usage examples of substitutions in ROS 2 launch files.

Prerequisites
-------------

This tutorial uses the :doc:`turtlesim <../../Beginner-CLI-Tools/Introducing-Turtlesim/Introducing-Turtlesim>` package.
This tutorial also assumes you are familiar with :doc:`creating packages <../../Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-Your-First-ROS2-Package>`.

As always, don't forget to source ROS 2 in :doc:`every new terminal you open <../../Beginner-CLI-Tools/Configuring-ROS2-Environment>`.

Using substitutions
-------------------

1 Create and setup the package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, create a new package with the name ``launch_tutorial``:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Python package

    Create a new package of build_type ``ament_python``:

    .. code-block:: console

      $ ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python --license Apache-2.0 launch_tutorial

  .. group-tab:: C++ package

    Create a new package of build_type ``ament_cmake``:

    .. code-block:: console

      $ ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake --license Apache-2.0 launch_tutorial

Inside of that package, create a directory called ``launch``:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: console

      $ mkdir launch_tutorial/launch

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: console

      $ mkdir launch_tutorial/launch

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: console

      $ md launch_tutorial/launch

Finally, make sure to install the launch files:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: Python package

    Add in following changes to the ``setup.py`` of the package:

    .. code-block:: python

      import os
      from glob import glob
      from setuptools import find_packages, setup

      package_name = 'launch_tutorial'

      setup(
          # Other parameters ...
          data_files=[
              # ... Other data files
              # Include all launch files.
              (os.path.join('share', package_name, 'launch'), glob('launch/*'))
          ]
      )

  .. group-tab:: C++ package

    Append following code to the ``CMakeLists.txt`` just before ``ament_package()``:

    .. code-block:: cmake

      install(DIRECTORY
              launch
              DESTINATION share/${PROJECT_NAME}/
      )



2 Parent launch file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's create a launch file that will call and pass arguments to another launch file.
This launch file can either be in YAML, XML, or in Python.

To do this, create following file in the ``launch`` folder of the ``launch_tutorial`` package.

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: XML

    Copy and paste the complete code into the ``launch/example_main_launch.xml`` file:

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_main_launch.xml
      :language: xml

    The ``$(find-pkg-share launch_tutorial)`` substitution is used to find the path to the ``launch_tutorial`` package.
    The path substitution is then joined with the ``example_substitutions_launch.xml`` file name.

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_main_launch.xml
      :language: xml
      :lines: 4

    The ``background_r`` variable with ``turtlesim_ns`` and ``use_provided_red`` arguments is passed to the ``include`` action.
    The ``$(var background_r)`` substitution is used to define the ``new_background_r`` argument with the value of the ``background_r`` variable.

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_main_launch.xml
      :language: xml
      :lines: 5-7

  .. group-tab:: YAML

    Copy and paste the complete code into the ``launch/example_main_launch.yaml`` file:

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_main_launch.yaml
      :language: yaml

    The ``$(find-pkg-share launch_tutorial)`` substitution is used to find the path to the ``launch_tutorial`` package.
    The path substitution is then joined with the ``example_substitutions_launch.yaml`` file name.

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_main_launch.yaml
      :language: yaml
      :lines: 8

    The ``background_r`` variable with ``turtlesim_ns`` and ``use_provided_red`` arguments is passed to the ``include`` action.
    The ``$(var background_r)`` substitution is used to define the ``new_background_r`` argument with the value of the ``background_r`` variable.

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_main_launch.yaml
      :language: yaml
      :lines: 9-15


  .. group-tab:: Python

    Copy and paste the complete code into the ``launch/example_main.launch.py`` file:

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_main_launch.py
      :language: python

    The ``FindPackageShare`` substitution is used to find the path to the ``launch_tutorial`` package.
    The ``PathJoinSubstitution`` substitution is then used to join the path to that package path with the ``example_substitutions.launch.py`` file name.

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_main_launch.py
      :language: python
      :lines: 14-18

    The ``launch_arguments`` dictionary with ``turtlesim_ns`` and ``use_provided_red`` arguments is passed to the ``IncludeLaunchDescription`` action.

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_main_launch.py
      :language: python
      :lines: 19-23


3 Substitutions example launch file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now create the substitution launch file in the same folder:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: XML

    Create the file ``launch/example_substitutions_launch.xml`` and insert the following code:

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_substitutions_launch.xml
      :language: xml

    The ``turtlesim_ns``, ``use_provided_red``, and ``new_background_r`` launch configurations are defined.
    They are used to store values of launch arguments in the above variables and to pass them to required actions.
    The launch configuration arguments can later be used with the ``$(var <name>)`` substitution to acquire the value of the launch argument in any part of the launch description.

    The ``arg`` tag is used to define the launch argument that can be passed from the above launch file or from the console.

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_substitutions_launch.xml
      :language: xml
      :lines: 3-5

    The ``turtlesim_node`` node with the ``namespace`` set to the ``turtlesim_ns`` launch configuration value using the ``$(var <name>)`` substitution is defined.

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_substitutions_launch.xml
      :language: xml
      :lines: 7

    Afterwards, an ``executable`` action is defined with the corresponding ``cmd`` tag.
    This command makes a call to the spawn service of the turtlesim node.

    Additionally, the ``$(var <name>)`` substitution is used to get the value of the ``turtlesim_ns`` launch argument to construct a command string.

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_substitutions_launch.xml
      :language: xml
      :lines: 8

    The same approach is used for the ``ros2 param`` ``executable`` actions that change the turtlesim background's red color parameter.
    The difference is that the second action inside of the timer is only executed if the provided ``new_background_r`` argument equals ``200`` and the ``use_provided_red`` launch argument is set to ``True``.
    The evaluation of the ``if`` predicate is done using the ``$(eval <python-expression>)`` substitution.

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_substitutions_launch.xml
      :language: xml
      :lines: 9-13

  .. group-tab:: YAML

    Create the file ``launch/example_substitutions_launch.yaml`` and insert the following code:

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_substitutions_launch.yaml
      :language: yaml

    The ``turtlesim_ns``, ``use_provided_red``, and ``new_background_r`` launch configurations are defined.
    They are used to store values of launch arguments in the above variables and to pass them to required actions.
    The launch configuration arguments can later be used with the ``$(var <name>)`` substitution to acquire the value of the launch argument in any part of the launch description.

    The ``arg`` tag is used to define the launch argument that can be passed from the above launch file or from the console.

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_substitutions_launch.yaml
      :language: yaml
      :lines: 4-12

    The ``turtlesim_node`` node with the ``namespace`` set to the ``turtlesim_ns`` launch configuration value using the ``$(var <name>)`` substitution is defined.

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_substitutions_launch.yaml
      :language: yaml
      :lines: 14-18

    Afterwards, an ``executable`` action is defined with the corresponding ``cmd`` tag.
    This command makes a call to the spawn service of the turtlesim node.

    Additionally, the ``$(var <name>)`` substitution is used to get the value of the ``turtlesim_ns`` launch argument to construct a command string.

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_substitutions_launch.yaml
      :language: yaml
      :lines: 19-20

    The same approach is used for the ``ros2 param`` ``executable`` actions that change the turtlesim background's red color parameter.
    The difference is that the second action inside of the timer is only executed if the provided ``new_background_r`` argument equals ``200`` and the ``use_provided_red`` launch argument is set to ``True``.
    The evaluation of the ``if`` predicate is done using the ``$(eval <python-expression>)`` substitution.

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_substitutions_launch.yaml
      :language: yaml
      :lines: 21-28

  .. group-tab:: Python

    Create the file ``launch/example_substitutions.launch.py`` and insert the following code:

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_substitutions_launch.py
      :language: python

    The ``turtlesim_ns``, ``use_provided_red``, and ``new_background_r`` launch configurations are defined.
    They are used to represent values of launch arguments in the above variables and to pass them to required actions.
    These ``LaunchConfiguration`` substitutions allow us to acquire the value of the launch argument in any part of the launch description.

    ``DeclareLaunchArgument`` is used to define the launch argument that can be passed from the above launch file or from the console.

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_substitutions_launch.py
      :language: python
      :lines: 14-25

    The ``turtlesim_node`` node with the ``namespace`` set to ``turtlesim_ns`` ``LaunchConfiguration`` substitution is defined.

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_substitutions_launch.py
      :language: python
      :lines: 26-31

    The next action, ``ExecuteProcess``,  is defined with the corresponding ``cmd`` argument to call the spawn service of the turtlesim node.

    Additionally, the ``LaunchConfiguration`` substitution is used to provide the value of the ``turtlesim_ns`` launch argument in the command string.

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_substitutions_launch.py
      :language: python
      :lines: 32-41

    The same approach is used for the ``change_background_r`` and ``change_background_r_conditioned`` actions that change the turtlesim background's red color parameter.
    The difference is that the next action is only executed if the provided ``new_background_r`` argument equals ``200`` and the ``use_provided_red`` launch argument is set to ``True``.
    The evaluation inside the ``IfCondition`` is done using the ``PythonExpression`` substitution.

    .. literalinclude:: launch/example_substitutions_launch.py
      :language: python
      :lines: 51-72

4 Build the package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go to the root of the workspace, and build the package:

.. code-block:: console

  $ colcon build

Also remember to source the workspace after building.

Launching example
-----------------

Now you can launch using the ``ros2 launch`` command.

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: YAML

    .. code-block:: console

        $ ros2 launch launch_tutorial example_main.launch.yaml

  .. group-tab:: XML

    .. code-block:: console

        $ ros2 launch launch_tutorial example_main_launch.xml

  .. group-tab:: Python

    .. code-block:: console

        $ ros2 launch launch_tutorial example_main.launch.py

This will do the following:

#. Start a turtlesim node with a blue background
#. Spawn the second turtle
#. Change the color to purple
#. Change the color to pink after two seconds if the provided ``background_r`` argument is ``200`` and ``use_provided_red`` argument is ``True``

Modifying launch arguments
--------------------------

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: YAML

    If you want to change the provided launch arguments, you can either update the ``background_r`` variable in the ``example_main.launch.yaml`` or launch the ``example_substitutions.launch.yaml`` with preferred arguments.
    To see arguments that may be given to the launch file, run the following command:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ ros2 launch launch_tutorial example_substitutions.launch.yaml --show-args

  .. group-tab:: XML

    If you want to change the provided launch arguments, you can either update the ``background_r`` variable in the ``example_main_launch.xml`` or launch the ``example_substitutions_launch.xml`` with preferred arguments.
    To see arguments that may be given to the launch file, run the following command:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ ros2 launch launch_tutorial example_substitutions_launch.xml --show-args

  .. group-tab:: Python

    If you want to change the provided launch arguments, you can either update them in ``launch_arguments`` dictionary in the ``example_main.launch.py`` or launch the ``example_substitutions.launch.py`` with preferred arguments.
    To see arguments that may be given to the launch file, run the following command:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ ros2 launch launch_tutorial example_substitutions.launch.py --show-args

This will show the arguments that may be given to the launch file and their default values.

.. code-block:: console

    Arguments (pass arguments as '<name>:=<value>'):

        'turtlesim_ns':
            no description given
            (default: 'turtlesim1')

        'use_provided_red':
            no description given
            (default: 'False')

        'new_background_r':
            no description given
            (default: '200')

Now you can pass the desired arguments to the launch file as follows:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: YAML

    .. code-block:: console

        $ ros2 launch launch_tutorial example_substitutions.launch.yaml turtlesim_ns:='turtlesim3' use_provided_red:='True' new_background_r:=200

  .. group-tab:: XML

    .. code-block:: console

        $ ros2 launch launch_tutorial example_substitutions_launch.xml turtlesim_ns:='turtlesim3' use_provided_red:='True' new_background_r:=200

  .. group-tab:: Python

    .. code-block:: console

        $ ros2 launch launch_tutorial example_substitutions.launch.py turtlesim_ns:='turtlesim3' use_provided_red:='True' new_background_r:=200

Documentation
-------------

`The launch documentation <https://github.com/ros2/launch/blob/{REPOS_FILE_BRANCH}/launch/doc/source/architecture.rst>`_ provides detailed information about available substitutions.

Summary
-------

In this tutorial, you learned about using substitutions in launch files.
You learned about their possibilities and capabilities to create reusable launch files.

You can now learn more about :doc:`using event handlers in launch files <./Using-Event-Handlers>` which are used to define a complex set of rules which can be used to dynamically modify the launch file.
